Weekend Update
=============
For Your Not So Serious Stories And Maps*  
Inspired By Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update Segment

Includes:

* Sample Images
* Conus/Europe GeoJson
* World GeoJson
* Tilemill Carto-CSS Style Sheets
* Esri MXD
* Esri Shapefiles

The Conus/Europe Files Were Drawn By Hand And Include Color And State Name Attributes.  
The World File Started From The [Natural Earth Admin-0] (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/), Includes Mostly-Only Rank 0 Countries   
And Was Then Generalized Down To Accommodate For File Size. It Also Includes Color And  
Country Name Attributes.

Finally, I Used The Color Palette [From This Photo] (http://dvrlife.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/update_desk.jpg)
